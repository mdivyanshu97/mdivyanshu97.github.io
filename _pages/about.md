## ðŸ“° Welcome to My Website!

I'm **Divyanshu Mishra**, a PhD student in the Department of Engineering Science at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), supervised by [Professor Alison Noble](https://ibme.ox.ac.uk/person/alison-noble/). I am honored to be fully-funded by the **Athena-Bronze Scholarship**. My research focuses on **Computer Vision** and its applications in the medical domain. Currently, I am working on **multi-modal learning**, **video understanding**, and **federated learning** in **fetal-ultrasound videos**, particularly aiming to enhance the detection of **Congenital Heart Diseases**.

I have interned at **Amazon Science** as an **Applied Scientist**, where I focused on **Video-LLMs** and developed training methodologies that utilize single-modality to reduce dependency on paired data. Prior to my PhD, I worked as a **Data Scientist** at the [Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI)](https://thsti.res.in/), Government of India under the supervision of [Prof. Shinjini Bhatnagar](https://thsti.res.in/en/faculty-profile/Shinjini-Bhatanagar). This role allowed me to apply my analytical skills to real-world health challenges, further fueling my passion for research and innovation in healthcare technology.

Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my projects, publications, and reach out if interested in my work.

            <h3>Dual Conditioned Diffusion Models for Out-of-Distribution Detection: Application to Fetal Ultrasound Videos</h3>
            <p><small><b>Divyanshu Mishra</b>,He Zhao, Pramit Saha,Aris T. Papageorghiou & J. Alison Noble <br>

            <i>MICCAI 2023</i> <br>

           Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential to improve the reliability of machine learning models by detecting samples that do not belong to the training distribution. We introduce Dual Conditioned Diffusion models (DCDM) to detect OOD samples in Ultrasound videos given we have information only about ID samples during training.

            <h3>Rethinking Semi-Supervised Federated Learning: How to Co-train Fully-Labeled and Fully-Unlabeled Client Imaging Data</h3>
            <p><small>Pramit Saha,<b>Divyanshu Mishra</b>, J. Alison Noble <br>
            <i>MICCAI 2023</i> <br>

           The most challenging, yet practical, setting of semi-supervised federated learning (SSFL) is where a few clients have fully labeled data whereas the other clients have fully unlabeled data. This is particularly common in healthcare settings where collaborating partners (typically hospitals) may have images but not annotations. We propose IsoFed that circumvents the problem by avoiding simple averaging of supervised and semi-supervised models together.
